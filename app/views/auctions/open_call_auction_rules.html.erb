<h1>Rules for Open Call</h1>

<p>Open Calls are a method for agencies to share specific problems that they are trying to solve. If an individual or company works in that particular area, they can indicate interest via the Open Call form. Agencies then have the discretion to pursue an auction or procurement in the future and to reach out to any of the companies who registered interest.</p>
