  <p>NYC OpenBid is an experiment in city government that allows vendors to bid on select projects from the City of New York. This initiative provides another pathway to City contracts for small and Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs).</p>

  <p>The platform currently hosts two types of opportunities: Sealed Bids, which are active projects from agencies seeking bids, and Open Calls, which allow vendors to register interest in potential agency projects.</p>

  <p>To bid, you must have an active <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account and <a href="https://a127-pip.nyc.gov/webapp/PRDPCW/SelfService">register your company</a> on the <a href="https://a127-pip.nyc.gov/webapp/PRDPCW/SelfService">Payee Information Portal</a>. Learn more at our <a href="/about">About</a> and <a href="/policies">Policies</a> pages.
