  <p>Open Bid is the place to bid on open-source software projects from the City of New York. The platform connects New York City-based software vendors and City agencies. Through Open Bid, City agencies can engage with a larger, more inclusive, vendor pool - including companies participating in the City’s Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) program. Minority and Women-owned Businesses represent an avenue by which we can address income inequality and strengthen the state of our economy. M/WBEs provide real jobs that help to increase financial stability for many and drive local economic growth. The City encourages a competitive and diverse business environment that increases contracting opportunities and participation among City-certified M/WBE firms. Open Bid contributes to the City’s efforts to create an environment that gives a wide array of firms a chance to earn City contracts.</p>
